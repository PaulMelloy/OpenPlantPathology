 Please click this URL to join. https://usq.zoom.us/j/96442319336\n	Descr
 iption: The vulnerability of the Australian maize industry to Puccina so
 rghi is currently unknown. Maize is grown across a range of agro-ecologi
 cal regions in Australia and the effectiveness and stability of deployed
  Rp genes has not been examined. Further to this\, assessments of the P.
  sorghi population to determine pathotype diversity have not been conduc
 ted for many years. The current study was undertaken to assess phenotypi
 c\, genetic and physiological resistance to common rust and provide supp
 ort for maize breeding programs in Australia.\n\n\nOr an H.323/SIP room
