 iption: Plant pathogens cause disease through secreted effector proteins
 \, which act to modulate their hosts physiology and promote infection. T
 ypically\, the sequence of effector proteins provides little functional 
 information and further targeted experimentation is required. We look to
  utilise structural biology and biochemical approaches to help us unders
 tand effector function. In this talk I will present lessons learnt from 
 our structural studies of SnTox3\, an effector from the fungal pathogen 
 Parastagonospora nodorum. This will include methodologies we developed t
 hat can be employed to work with other cysteine-rich effectors. I will a
 lso present data that support the definition of a new class of fungal ef
 fectors and how the identification and classification of these effectors
  will have implications for the approaches used to study them.\n\nOr joi
