      <description>Since the early times, plant pathologists faced the need to deal with data and and quantitative analysis using mathematics and, more recently, computational tools. The leaders in the field were a relatively small international group of scientists with various backgrounds related to plant pathology that felt the need to connect and then Plant Disease Epidemiology was formally recognized as a discipline more than 50 years ago.</description>
