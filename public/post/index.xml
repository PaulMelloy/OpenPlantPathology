      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the early times, plant pathologists faced the need to deal with data and and quantitative analysis using mathematics and, more recently, computational tools. The leaders in the field were a relatively small international group of scientists with various backgrounds related to plant pathology that felt the need to connect and then &lt;strong&gt;Plant Disease Epidemiology&lt;/strong&gt; was formally recognized as a discipline more than 50 years ago.  Since then, plant epidemiologists have met several times around the world to network, brainstorm and learn from each other to advance the discipline by sharing ideas, experiences, knowledge and philosophical viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international workshop has been central for ensuring the exchange of ideas and information in our field and helps to identify/strengthen new/established links with other fields. The strong connections with mathematics/statistics, genetics and computer science have led to a sort of &lt;em&gt;speciation&lt;/em&gt; over the years: computational, theoretical, spatial, molecular, landscape, and digital (big data) epidemiology have popped up in the epidemiology literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution is natural and such links provide the field with opportunities to bring new expertise and advance our understanding and ability to predict and prevent economically damaging plant disease epidemics and crop losses at various scales. On the other hand, specialization may pose challenges for plant pathologists in general and the scientists need to stay more tightly connected and up to date with the advances on all these fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent and rapid  advances in technology have led to new opportunities as well as challenges. In particular, the increasing ability to collect large amounts of data from various scales (from genomes to landscapes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such scenarios require even more diverse skills from plant pathologists to stay alert and connected. The ease with which plant disease-related data (e.g., sequencing and phenotyping) can be obtained and treated with out-of-the-box algorithms by research groups (that lack epidemiologists) can lead to false promises and disastrous consequences for the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plant disease epidemiologists has always been a leader in using quantitative, statistical and computational approaches, which distinguished us from other plant pathologists. Early on, computers have been one of the main tools in the plant epidemiologist&amp;rsquo;s tool-box - until recently these computer based tools were very specialized field and relied on expensive,  proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plethora of computer software  was developed by leading epidemiologists over the decades and used for research and teaching purposes. However, problems related to technology life-time, portability, compatibility and reproducibility have affected rate of adoption and sustainability. It is thus imperative that more &lt;strong&gt;sustainable, transparent and reproducible research&lt;/strong&gt; methods are developed and deployed for the community with the purpose of formal training and research support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel that it is more important than ever that plant disease epidemiologists &lt;strong&gt;stay connected&lt;/strong&gt; and propose that web-based networking tools should be used for effective networking and continued collaboration to promote the field beyond the actual workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these issues, we propose to develop a &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt; that values the &lt;strong&gt;sharing&lt;/strong&gt; of knowledge, ideas and data; building capacity; and promotes open and &lt;strong&gt;reproducible&lt;/strong&gt; research to benefit plant epidemiologists. To foster this community, we propose to develop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A community-maintained &lt;strong&gt;website&lt;/strong&gt; to promote open science and connect plant pathologists: people/lab directory, workshop history, blog posts (new articles, tutorials, view-points, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An open &lt;strong&gt;chatting workspace&lt;/strong&gt; using Slack to enable effective, year-round communication and collaborative work via specific channels, i.e., a Slack workspace open to any interested party (plantepidem.slack.com).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, a community that stimulates and supports efforts from individuals or groups to develop and deliver next-generation databases and reproducible research &lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt; for PDE-related subjects and applications (teaching or research) using open source software (e.g., R, Python), open data (e.g., Dryad, Figshare, OSF, Genbank, etc.), and open software repositories (e.g., GitHub).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome your participation in this community and hope that you will join us. To join the Slack workgroup, please send a request to XXXX. Our repositories are available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.github.com/XXXXX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.github.com/XXXXX&lt;/a&gt;, to request to join them please send a message to Adam Sparks or Emerson Del Ponte after you have joined the Slack workgroup.&lt;/p&gt;
