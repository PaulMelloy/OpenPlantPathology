      <description>OpenPlantPathology (OPP) fosters a culture that values open, transparent and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software.
 We do this by:
Creating social infrastructure through a welcoming, engaged and diverse community in a Slack chatting workspace and on Twitter.  How to join and what to do? (click on the image to send email)

Creating technical infrastructure by selecting well-recognised leaders from computational plant pathology to help direct and engage the community, and create community-contributed web-based (website and GitHub) open source software tools that provide scientific data sources and instructional materials for self-instruction or classroom settings.</description>
