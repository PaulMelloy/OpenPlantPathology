abstract = "<img src = '/img/learning/info-theory1.png' align=right>The use of information theoretic quantities to explain recipients’ differential responses to decision support outputs was first proposed by McRoberts et al at the ICPP in Christchurch in 2003. In the intervening 15 years a set of information theoretic concepts for epidemiologists, diagnosticians, and decision-makers has been developed and summarized in a book by Hughes and several papers by Hughes, McRoberts and others. The [Workshop](https://robchoudhury.github.io/InformationTheory/index.html)  will combine lectures on concepts with practical computer exercises to allow participants to learn to calculate key information quantities that are important in understanding how DSS’s and diagnostics work, fundamentally, by capturing information from the world and making it available for use in decision-making."
