The Virtual Seminars (aka science webinar) is a venue for delivering scientific talks of general interest to a plant pathology audience. Anyone is welcome to contribute a seminar.

- The seminars are pre-approved and [disseminated widely](https://twitter.com/OpenPlantPath).

- It is live broadcast via Zoom at a date & time at speaker's convenience.
