<div class=body style = "background-color: #f6f6f6; padding: 15px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-top: 30px;">The Open Plant Pathology (OPP) initiative supports and promotes <strong> openness, transparency and reproducibility </strong> of scientific research data and methods applied to plant pathological research and applications.

<h3>How did we make this possible?</h3>

We strongly believe that building a social infrastructure through a welcoming, engaged and diverse community is key for sharing knowledge and supporting others for adoption of a new culture.

<h3> What can you expect from joining OPP?</h3>
There may be several benefits from either following us or engaging and promoting OPP:

- Learn about open science and reproducible research in the context of plant pathology

- Meet new colleagues (who can become your future collaborator) by joining our <a href = "https://openplantpathology.slack.com" alt = "Open Plant Pathology Slack Workgroup" title = "Open Plant Pathology Slack Workgroup">Slack chatting workspace</a> who can help you out with any question

- Scientific exchange via freely available Virtual Seminars

<h3>Whose idea was Open Plant Pathology?</h3>

OpenPlantPathology is a not for-profit initiative founded in January 2018 by <a href = "https://delpontelab.netlify.com/pages/emerson-delponte/"> Emerson Del Ponte</a> and <a href= "https://adamhsparks.com/">Adam Sparks</a> to facilitate communication among computational plant pathologists and promote open science and reproducible research practices in plant pathology.

Of course, this would not be possible without the support from several colleagues who helped spread the initiative and the culture of open science.
