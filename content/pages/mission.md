<h3>What are we up to?</h3>
<div class=body style = "background-color: #f6f6f6; padding: 15px; margin-bottom:40px; margin-top: 30px">Open Plant Pathology (OPP) fosters a diverse <b>community culture</b> that values <strong> openness, transparency and reproducibility </strong> of scientific research data and methods applied to plant pathological research and applications.
</div>

<br>
<h3>How do we make this possible?</h3>
<img src ="/img/mission1.png" align = right>
We strongly believe that bulding a social infrastructure through a welcoming, engaged and diverse community is key for sharing knowledge and supporting others for adoption of a new culture. We did this by creating a community website, a collaborative coding platform on GitHub and a <a href = "https://openplantpathology.slack.com" alt = "Open Plant Pathology Slack Workgroup" title = "Open Plant Pathology Slack Workgroup">Slack chatting workspace</a>.


<br>
<h3> What to expect from joining OPP?</h3>

<img src ="/img/mission2.png" align = right>
Socialize and meet new colleagues and potential future collaborators! ask/answer questions and engage in our discussions to follow what others are doing. Use your skill to contribute open source software tools for self or collaborative research. Finally, engage in or propose a new team.

<br><br>
<h3>Who started all this?</h3>

OpenPlantPathology is a not for-profit scientific community founded in January 2018 by <a href = "https://delpontelab.netlify.com/pages/emerson-delponte/"> Emerson Del Ponte</a> and <a href= "https://adamhsparks.github.io/">Adam Sparks</a> to facilitate communication among computational plant pathologists and promote open science and reproducible research practices in plant pathology.</p>
