It is important for food, sarch,etc. The biotic contraints to its production include viral diseases, the arsenal of tools available for its management currently include breeding molecular breeding, technology driven sourcin of planting material, apps for disease diagnostics and sequencING tools for small scale farmers. The level of technology being used is so high and given that it's been developed for small scale growers it has great impact. It is a case study where technology piloted in Africa can be scaled up for  the rest of the world</br></br>Date: 04 May 2020 </br> Time: 09:00 CDT ([Convert time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Sally+Mallowa%3A+Technology+driven+cassava+pest+management&iso=20200504T09&p1=627&ah=1))</br><br>"
