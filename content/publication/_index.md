The Virtual Seminars (aka science webinar) are a venue for delivering scientific talks of general interest to a plant pathology audience. Here is how it works:

- The seminars are pre-approved and the invitation [disseminated widely](https://twitter.com/OpenPlantPath),

- It is live broadcast via Zoom - date & time at speaker's convenience,

- The speaker is available to answer questions from the audience after the seminar (e.g. up to 1 hour) either within the Zoom chat and/or on the OPP slack channel,

- The live event will be recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel,

- Video file and all associated materials (slides, chat texts, codes, etc.) will be made freely accessible under the [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license.
