The Virtual Seminars (aka science webinar) is a venue for delivering scientific talks of general interest to a plant pathology audience. Here is how it works:

- The seminars are live broadcasted at a date & time at speaker's convenience 
- The speaker will be available to answer questions from from the audience after the seminar (e.g. up to 1 hour) either within the chat and/or on the OPP slack channel 
- A video will be recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel
- The video and all associated materials (slides, chat texts, codes, etc) will be made freely acessible

- [Submit your proposal of Virtual Seminar](https://github.com/openplantpathology/opp_notes)

Coordination:  
Dr. Benjamin Schwassinger
