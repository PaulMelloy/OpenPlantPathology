abstract = "<img src = '/img/seminars/peter-solomon.png' width = 500 align = right style = 'padding:40px'>It had long been thought that necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungi use a barrage of lytic enzymes to break down host cells releasing nutrients for growth. However, in recent years it has emerged that some necrotrophic fungi facilitate disease through a strict gene-for-gene mechanism as observed in biotrophic pathogens. For the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum, the basis of this host specific interaction is small cysteine-rich effector proteins secreted during infection (ToxA, Tox1 and Tox3). These effectors interact with specific dominant susceptibility genes in the host leading to a programmed cell death response and disease. However, whilst we now understand the requirement of these effector proteins for disease, their modes of action remain poorly understood. In this talk I will present our latest findings on dissecting the dual functionality of the Tox3 effector protein and how this has serendipitously advanced our understanding of the enigmatic host defence protein, PR-1.</br></br>Date: 20 April 2020 </br> Time: 19:00 AEST ([Convert time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Peter+Solomon%3A+How+the+study+of+necrotrophic+effectors+advanced+our+understanding+of+the+enigmatic+P&iso=20200420T19&p1=57&ah=1))</br><br>"
