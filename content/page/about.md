The Open Plant Pathology is community of computational scientists who values the sharing of knowledge, ideas and data; building capacity; and promotes open and reproducible research to benefit plant epidemiologists. To foster this community, we propose to develop:

- A community-maintained website to promote plant epidemiology and the IEW: people/lab directory, workshop history, blog posts (new articles, tutorials, view-points, etc.).

- An open chatting workspace using Slack to enable effective, year-round communication and collaborative work via specific channels, i.e., a Slack workspace open to any interested party (plantepidem.slack.com).

- More broadly, a community that stimulates and supports efforts from individuals or groups to develop and deliver next-generation databases and reproducible research tools for PDE-related subjects and applications (teaching or research) using open source software (e.g., R, Python), open data (e.g., Dryad, Figshare, OSF, Genbank, etc.), and open software repositories (e.g., GitHub).

We welcome your participation in this community and hope that you will join us. To join the Slack workgroup, please send a request to XXXX. Our repositories are available at https://www.github.com/XXXXX, to request to join them please send a message to Adam Sparks or Emerson Del Ponte after you have joined the Slack workgroup.
