<h2> What is Open Plant Pathology?</h2>
A community of modelers and computational researchers involved in plant pathological work (plant disease epidemiology and pathogen population biology and ecology) that believes that science should be as open, transparent and reproducible as possible. More broadly, the goal of this community is to support effort from individuals or groups to develop and deliver next-generation databases and tools for plant pathology-related subjects and applications (teaching or research) using open source software, data and repositories.
