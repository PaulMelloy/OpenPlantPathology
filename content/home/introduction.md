Open Plant Pathology is an <a href="pages/mission">initiative</a> that supports and promotes the spread of all <strong>open, transparent and reproducible</strong> practices in the field of plant pathology.
We advocate for an open science culture and our teams work to enhance this culture by:

- Offering [Workshops](/talk) presentially or via webinars

- Organizing [Virtual Seminars](/publication) for enhacing scientific exchanges

- Developing [open sources tools](https://github.com/openplantpathology/) 

- Supporting Editorial Boards of journals to enhance [reproducibility](http://sbfitopatologia.org.br/tpp/post/reproducibility-editor/)
