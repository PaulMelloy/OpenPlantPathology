Open Plant Pathology is an <a href="pages/mission">initiative</a> that supports and promotes the spread of all <strong>open science</strong> practices in the field Plant Pathology. We advocate for a culture of sharing scientific data and computational codes that leads to more transparency and reproducibility of methods. We have a few projects that everyone is welcome to join or propose new ones.
