<h2> What is Open Plant Pathology?</h2>

<p>A community of modelers and computational researchers involved in plant
pathology, plant disease epidemiology, pathogen population biology, microbial
ecology and genomics, that supports the several forms of Open Science
practices in Plant Pathology. We support efforts from individuals or groups
to develop and deliver next-generation databases and tools for plant pathology-
related subjects and applications using open source software, data and
repositories.</p>

<h2>Our Vision and Mission</h2>

<p>OpenPlantPathology (OPP) fosters a culture that values open, transparent and
reproducible research using shared data and reusable software.</p>

<p>We do this by:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Creating technical <strong>infrastructure</strong> in the form of
selecting well-recognised leaders from computational plant pathology to help
direct and engage the community, and create community-contributed open source
software tools that provide scientific data sources and instructional materials
for self-instruction or classroom settings.</p></li>

<li><p>Creating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse
<strong>community</strong> 
(<a href = "https://openplantpathology.slack.com" alt = "Open Plant Pathlogy Slack Workgroup" title = "Open Plant Pathology Slack Workgroup">openplantpathology.slack.com</a>).
Drop us an <a href = "mailto:openplantpathology@gmail.com" subject= "Interested
to join your Slack Workgroup">e-mail</a> if you are interested to join our
workgroup.</p></li>

<li><p>Building <strong>capacity</strong> of computational plant pathologists and
fostering a sense of pride in their work.</p></li>

<li><p>Promoting <strong>advocacy</strong> for a culture of data sharing, reusable
software and instructional materials in the field of plant pathology.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>OpenPlantPathology is a community founded in 2018 by Emerson Del Ponte and
Adam Sparks to facilitate communication among computational plant pathologists
and promote open science and reproducible research practices in plant
pathology.</p>
