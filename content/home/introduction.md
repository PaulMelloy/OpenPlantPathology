<h2> What is Open Plant Pathology?</h2>

<p>A <strong>community</strong> of modelers and computational researchers involved in plant disease epidemiology, pathogen population biology/ecology and genomics, that believes that science should be as open, transparent and reproducible as possible. We support efforts from individuals or groups to develop and deliver next-generation databases and tools for plant pathology-related subjects and applications using open source software, data and repositories.</p>
