<h2> What is Open Plant Pathology?</h2>

<p>We are a community of plant pathologists, mostly computationally-oriented, that supports the several forms of <strong>Open Science</strong> practices. We support efforts from individuals or groups to develop and deliver next-generation databases and tools for plant pathology-related subjects and applications using open source software, data and repositories.</p>
