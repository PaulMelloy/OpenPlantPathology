<h2>Our Vision and Mission</h2>

<p>OpenPlantPathology (OPP) fosters a culture that values open, transparent and
reproducible research using shared data and reusable software.</p>

<p>We do this by:</p>


<ul>
<li><p>Creating technical <strong>infrastructure</strong> in the form of selecting
well-recognised leaders from computational plant pathology to help direct and
engage the community, and create community-contributed open source software
tools that provide scientific data sources and instructional materials for
self-instruction or classroom settings.></p</li>

<li><p>Creating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse
<strong>community</strong>
(<a href = https://openplantpathology.slack.com">https://openplantpathology.slack.com</a>).
Drop us an <a href = "mailto:openplantpathology@gmail.com" subject= "Interested
to join your Slack Workgroup">e-mail</a> if you are interested to join our
workgroup.</p></li>

<li><p>Building <strong>capacity</strong> of computational plant pathologists and
fostering a sense of pride in their work.</p></li>

<li><p>Promoting <strong>advocacy</strong> for a culture of data sharing, reusable
software and instructional materials in the field of plant pathology.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>OpenPlantPathology is a community founded in 2018 by Emerson Del Ponte and
Adam Sparks to facilitate communication among computational plant pathologists
and promote open science and reproducible research practices in plant
pathology.</p>
