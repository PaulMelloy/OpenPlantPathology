# Our Vision and Mission

OpenPlantPathology (OPP) fosters a culture that values open, transparent and
reproducible research using shared data and reusable software.

We do this by:

- Creating technical **infrastructure** in the form of selecting well-
recognised leaders from computational plant pathology to help direct and
engage the community, and create community-contributed open source software
tools that provide scientific data sources and instructional materials for
self-instruction or classroom settings.

- Creating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse **community**
([openplantpathology.slack.com](https://openplantpathology.slack.com)).

- Building **capacity** of computational plant pathologists and fostering a
sense of pride in their work.

- Promoting **advocacy** for a culture of data sharing, reusable software and
instructional materials in the field of plant pathology.

OpenPlantPathology is a community founded in 2018 by Emerson Del Ponte and
Adam Sparks to facilitate communication among computational plant pathologists
and promote open science and reproducible research practices in plant
pathology.
