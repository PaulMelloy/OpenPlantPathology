We strongly believe that building a social infrastructure through a welcoming, engaged and diverse community is key for sharing knowledge and supporting others for adoption of a new culture.\nBenefits\nThere may be several benefits from either following us or engaging and promoting OPP:\nLearn about open science/education and reproducible research in the context of plant pathology\nMeet new colleagues (who can become your future collaborators) by joining our Slack workspace who can help you out with any question\nAcademic and scientific exchange via freely available Virtual Seminars on our YouTube channel\n\n\n\n",
